# DragonPiece
Pertains to the October 2023 MLH DataHackfest.

As of 3:10 AM PST on OCTOBER 15, 2023:
This repository contains an Alpha draft of the .HTML, .CSS, .JS, and .PNG logo "DragonPiece" files. There is a python file named 'api_caller.py' in the DragonPiece_TEST folder, which is the most recent of the iterations.

As of the time of this message, the function is theoretically attached to the backend development; however proper testing has not been performed to ensure successful operation. The HTTP/CSS/JS is effectively a mockup (at the least) which should perform in browser, and the backend development has proven successful in its own regard by generating various facets of unique content as intended. 


The HTML/CSS/JS markup was tested in Mozilla Firefox 118.0.2 (64-bit).
